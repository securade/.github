## Overview
We protect your workers and projects with award winning Generative AI based video analytics technology that predicts and prevents accidents.​ We have built three products - HUB, Tower and Sentinel that work together to improve the safety and security of your workplaces.

### Securade.ai HUB

A generative AI based edge platform for computer vision that connects to existing CCTV cameras and makes them smart.

Securade.ai HUB uses natural language text and generative AI to automatically train and fine-tune state-of-the-art computer vision models on the edge. This eliminates costly data labelling and annotations work typically required in training new models. Thus, enabling us to deploy a custom accurate model per camera feed.

### Securade.ai Tower

A self contained kit for mobile deployments that includes a HUB, 4G internet, 2 cameras, a screen, a power back up with UPS and an industrial socket point for charging, all packaged in an IP66 weatherproof enclosure.  

The Securade.ai Tower is primarily targeted at the construction industry were the deployment of CCTV cameras and network connectivity is a challenge. This self contained kit includes everything that is needed to get started and can be powered on for hours even without the need for charging. The Tower integrates with existing industrial power generators and solar panels on site, it can also be mounted on concrete poles as needed.

### Securade.ai Sentinel

A monitoring and surveillance application that enables visual Q&A and video captioning for existing CCTV cameras.

Securade.ai Sentinel uses generative AI and LLMs to automatically analyse live video feeds from CCTV cameras to recognise activities and record them as text. The live video feeds can also be queried in natural language to answer questions in a chatGPT like interface.
